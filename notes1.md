- A JavaScript Superset
- A Language building up on JS
- Adds new Features + Advantages to JS
- Browser CAN'T excute it!
- It's a complier which will be complied to JS

## Why TypeScript?

`JavaScript`

```
function add (num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num3;
}

console.log(add('2', '3')) // => 23
```

The above might result in unwanted behavior at Runtime;
Type is a "Tool" that helps developers write better code
